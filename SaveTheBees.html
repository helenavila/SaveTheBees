<p>"according to all known laws of aviation, there's no way a bee should be able to fly. it's wings are too small to lift its fat little body off the ground. the bee, of course, flies anyway - because bees don't care what humans think is impossible." -Bee Movie</p>

<h2>why you shouldn't kill bees:</h2>
<p>every bee that you swat and kill is one more step towards their dropping numbers. </p>
<h3><em>once again, no reason to be afraid.. haha</em></h3>
<p>bees are not aggressive creatures. sure, they’ll protect their nest, but they don’t really want to sting you (mostly because, you know, that kills them). if they’re flying around you, they’re probably just drawn to the color or scent you’re wearing so back off. </p>
